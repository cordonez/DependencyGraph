# Asset dependency graph
A editor tool for the engine Unity3D that shows in a visual way the dependencies between assets.

This tool will show in a graph the references and dependencies between all the assets in your project. If you ever wondered who is using a texture, material, prefab, etc... now its easier than ever without having to check manually!

# How to use
Right click on an assets and select 'Show dependency graph'
